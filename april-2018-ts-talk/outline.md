-- do something like that



- Questions:

  - Does anyone have a background in Java, C#, C++?
  - What is static and dynamic typing?

- What is TypeScript

- What are the benefits of using TypeScript

- Ask: Who has a background in statically typed languages? (C#, Java, C++, etc)

- Non-nullable types and how TypeScript is different ("the billion dollar mistake"). If you are
  coming from a Java/C#/etc background, this is a huge improvement.

- How to express certain JavaScript concepts within TypeScript (union types, discriminated unions)

- Challenges in building a real world app.

- Escape hatches

-- Discuss any

- Typing system is helpful insofar as it helps catch errors early on, constraining in that it
  sometimes forces us into making decisions about how a program is structured early on

- 30 second challenge (??): find all the type errors in a small console JS app.

- Show off VSCode/IDE support if possible.
