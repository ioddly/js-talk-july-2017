<h1 style="text-align:center;">You Got Types in My JavaScript</h1>
---

JavaScript is dynamically typed

```javascript
let x = 5;
x = "cat";
x = {name: "Dave"};
// all valid things to do
```

---

Just because JavaScript is dynamically typed, doesn't mean there aren't rules about what can and
cannot be done with types

e.g. calling a string method on a number

```javascript
let x = 5;
x.slice(0);
// obviously an error
```

---

In larger programs, it's not always evident to the programmer or language runtime what type a
variable might have

```javascript
function something(x) {
  x.doSomething();
}
```

---

## The nightmare project

- A giant iOS application, written in CoffeeScript using "Titanium SDK"

- Time from compilation to running on an emulator or device was about 5 minutes

- Any typos would crash the program

- There was no way to evaluate JS expressions in the running program

---

![typescript](http://mherman.org/assets/img/blog/typescript-logo.png)

- From Microsoft, 2012

---

# What is TypeScript?

- Static type checker for JavaScript

- Strict superset of JavaScript

- Doesn't have its own runtime

---

Static typing is a way of making assertions about what values will be at compile time.

```typescript
let x : number = 5;
x.slice(0);
// Compiler error!
```

As we'll see, static and dynamic typing is more of a spectrum than a true/false proposition.

---

## What are the benefits of using TypeScript?

- Tighter feedback loop: catch more errors without having to run a program.

- More robust programs: prevents certain classes of errors

- Write less tests

- Better editing &amp; refactoring support 

---

## Statically typed languages can be very verbose

Some real Java code I wrote last year

```java
Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

final String alarmName = intent.getStringExtra("name");

ReactApplication reapp = ((ReactApplication) context.getApplicationContext());
ReactInstanceManager manager = reapp.getReactNativeHost().getReactInstanceManager();
ReactContext recontext = manager.getCurrentReactContext();
```

---

## Solution: type inference

```typescript
let x = 5;
x = "string"; 
// compiler error!
```

equivalent to our earlier code

```typescript
let x : number = 5;
```

- Type inference actually dates to 1958

---

## Union types

```typescript
let x : number | string = 5;
x = "string";
// this now passes the type checker
```

---

## Flow sensitive types

```typescript
if(typeof x === "number") {
  return x + 5;
} else if(typeof x === "string") {
  return parseInt(x, 10) + 5;
}
```

---

## Null

Null was introduced in the ALGOL language by Tony Hoare in 1965.

He calls it "the billion dollar mistake"

```javascript
let x = null;
x.doSomething();
// !!!
```

---

## Non-nullable types

As of TypeScript 2.0

```typescript
let age = 67;
age = undefined; // Error: Age ain't nothin but a number.
```

---

## Non-nullable types 2

```typescript
let something : number | undefined;

something = 12345;
// valid program
```

---

## Non-nullable types 3

```typescript
let something? : number;

something = 12345;
// valid
```

---

## Interfaces

How do we represent objects?

```javascript
function printPerson(person) {
  console.log(person.name, person.occupation);
}

printPerson({ name: 'Jim', occupation: 'Plumber '});
```

---

## Interfaces 2

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  occupation: string;
}

function printPerson(person: Person) {
  console.log(person.name, person.occupation);
}

printPerson({ name: 'Jim', occupation: 'Plumber' });
```

---

## Structural typing

Languages like Java, C#, etc have "nominative typing"

That is
```java
class Person {
  String name;
}

class Human {
  String name;
}
```

Person and Human cannot be used interchangably, even though they have the same fields

---

## Structural typing 2

In TypeScript, objects with the same fields are considered *the same*

```typescript
interface Human {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  name: string;
}

let p: Human = {name: "Jim"};
p = {name: "Bob"} as Person;
// valid code
```

---

## Enumerations

Common construct in other languages

There are various ways to emulate them in JS

```javascript
const Days = {
  Sunday: 0,
  Monday: 1,
  Tuesday: 2
  // ...
}
```

---

## Enumerations 2

```typescript
enum Days = {
  Sunday, // 0
  Monday, // 1
  Tuesday // 2
}
```

Can also be strings

```typescript
enum Days = {
  Sunday = "Sunday",
  Monday = "Monday",
  Tuesday = "Tuesday",
}
```

---

## Enumerations 3

```typescript
enum Day = {
  Sunday,
  Monday,
  Tuesday
}

let day = Sunday;
// giant switch statement
switch(day) {
  case Sunday:
  case Monday:
  case Tuesday:
}
```

---

## JSX support

For React, etc

JSX support comes out of the box -- no need to use babel

JSX HTML is also typechecked

```
<div klassName="mispelled"></div>;
// causes error
```

---

## Downsides of TypeScript

### JavaScript bindings

1. Sometimes not available

2. Sometimes not up-to-date

3. Sometimes not well-written

4. Writing your own is possible

5. Bindings can introduce additional oddities on top of the normal interface

---

### DefinitelyTyped

`npm install @types/react`

 a repository of type definitions for over 4,000 libraries

---

### Tooling complexity

Any moving part is a problem.

```javascript
resolve: {
  extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx'],
},

externals: ['window'],

plugins: [
  new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\.\/locale$/),
  sassExtract,
  new CheckerPlugin(), // async typescript error reporting
],

module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' },
```

---

### Error messages

`Type '{ route: "VIEW_MONTH"; date: Moment; entries: Entry[]; searchResults: undefined; searchString: un...' is not assignable to type 'JournalState'.
  Type '{ route: "VIEW_MONTH"; date: Moment; entries: Entry[]; searchResults: undefi`
...

---

### Escape hatches

#### Compiler configuration

- Many things (e.g. non-nullable types) can be disabled on a per-project basis
- TypeScript compiler will always do its best to produce sensible JavaScript code, even in the
  presence of errors

---

### Any

you got dynamic types in my static types

```typescript
let x: any;
x = 12345;
x = "cat";
x = { foo: 'bar' };
```

Typically you will use `any` when working with libraries for which bindings don't exist

(or if you're lazy...)

---

### Is it worth it?

- TypeScript and static type checking in general are useful insofar as they help us catch errors

- They also force us to make decisions about how a program will be structured early on: this can
  be both helpful and frustrating

---

### Is it worth it?

- I think so!

- For smaller projects, it may not make sense to add the tooling complexity

- For mature, well-tested JavaScript applications, it may not make sense to port to TypeScript


- There is a learning curve

---

### Bonus: Visual Studio Code

- Best JavaScript editor I've ever used

- Can take advantage of TypeScript bindings *even if you don't use TypeScript* for better
  completions
