## TypeScript

<Appear>
  <p>Statically typed superset of JavaScript</p>
  <p>From Microsoft in 2012</p>
  <p>Familiar names such as Anders Hejlsberg</p>
</Appear>

```notes
- [QUESTION] How many people in here use TypeScript?
- [QUESTION] How many people have heard of TypeScript
- I assume you're all in favor of static typing
- You probably all have to write JavaScript with the same enthusiasm I write Java
- So I didn't frontload this talk trying to explain JavaScript is or why types for it are a good idea
- What TypeScript is
- next
- how it brings types to JavaScript

```

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./first-1.js")}
  theme={codeTheme}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./first-2.ts")}
  theme={codeTheme}
  steps={[
    { tokens: { 1: [2,3] } },
    { range: [1,10] },
  ]}
/>

## The TypeScript philosophy

<Appear>
  <p>TypeScript is not a new programming language</p>
  <p>Follows the JavaScript language standard and semantics</p>
  <p><code>console.log(5 + 'cat')</code> is allowed</p>
  <p>Does not have its own runtime</p>
</Appear>


```notes
Although it's often billed as a programming language, TypeScript's goal is not to 
change the semantics of JavaScript

Semantics: '5' + cat is allowed

TypeScript is a compiler that produces JavaScript

This focus is why it is the most popular "types for frontend code" we've seen so far
```

---

## Differences between C# and TypeScript

TypeScript uses a *structural* type system

C# uses a *nominal* type system

```notes
En ingles, what does this mean?
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./structural.ts")}
  theme={codeTheme}
  steps={[
    { lines: [1, 2, 3] },
    { lines: [5,6] },
  ]}
/>

---

## TypeScript is unsound

```notes
This sounds scary

I probably sound like a used car salesman at this point

TypeScript has some niceties as a result of this
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./anonymous-object.js")}
  theme={codeTheme}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./anonymous-object.ts")}
  theme={codeTheme}
/>

```notes
I question the decision to call these interfaces
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./anonymous-object-2.ts")}
  theme={codeTheme}
/>

```notes
These are almost exactly equivalent
```

---

## Nullable types

<Appear>
  <p>Null was invented in 1965</p>
  <p>Called "the million dollar mistake"</p>
  <p>JavaScript adds even more pain</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Null was actually invented in 1965
I know some of you guys were probably in the room that happened
but it's kind of odd to think about

[QUESTION] How many people are familiar with this in C#?
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./nullable-1.ts")}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./nullable-2.ts")}
/>

```notes
This is a type guard
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./union-types.ts")}
/>

---

## And much more

<Appear>
  <p>Generics</p>
  <p>Enumerations</p>
  <p>Literal types</p>
  <p>Class visibility</p>
  <p>Decorators</p>
</Appear>

## JavaScript interaction

```notes
- So far we've talked about how TypeScript helps model JavaScript code
- How do you use existing JavaScript
```

---

## Bindings

<Appear>
  <p>Hopefully first-party</p>
  <p>DefinitelyTyped</p>
  <code>npm install @types/mylibrary</code>
  <p>üôè</p>
  <p>Roll your own</p>
</Appear>

## Any

```notes
- Don't reach for this first
- You'll get in trouble with me at code review time
```

---

## The future is bright

- TypeScript adoption is increasing

---

## Where to go next?
