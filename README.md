A talk I gave in July 2017 about modern JavaScript programming. The first half is a series of
slides demonstrating new features in ES2015 and later standards, and how to use tools like
Webpack, Babel and polyfills to make them available. The second half is a live-coding exercise in
which I build an app along with an ad hoc web framework, demonstrating the value of using a
framework as well as the power of the new features. Intended to be instructive to an audience of
mixed familiarity with JavaScript and common frameworks.
