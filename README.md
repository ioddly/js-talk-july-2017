This is a monorepo for all my talks: slides, code, repos. 

# [October 2018: Frontend Testing with React, Jest & react-testing-library](october-2018-test-talk)

A guide to frontend testing with React, jest and react-testing-library. Talks about how React's unidirectional data
flow lends itself well to testing, and discusses how to conceptualize tests in terms of inputs and outputs, applying
the simple `assert square(8) == 64` style of tests in every testing library's documentation to a real, advanced
program.

# [April 2018: You Got Types In My JavaScript](april-2018-ts-talk)

between nominal and structural typing.

# [July 2017: Intro to ES2015 with React](july-2017-js-talk)
