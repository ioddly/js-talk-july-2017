A talk I gave in July 2017 about modern JavaScript programming. The first half is a series of
slides demonstrating new features in ES2015 and later standards, and how to use tools like
Webpack, Babel and polyfills to make them available. The second half is a live-coding exercise in
which I build an app along with an ad hoc web framework, demonstrating the value of using a
framework as well as the power of the new features. Intended to be instructive to an audience of
mixed familiarity with JavaScript and common frameworks.

- [Mozilla Development Network](https://developer.mozilla.org). Best source of JavaScript/HTML
  documentation.

- [caniuse](http://caniuse.com). Quickly check browser support for features you'd like to use.

- [AirBNB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). A style guide that will enforce the
  use of many of these new features over old-style JavaScript.

- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). When configured to use the AirBNB style guide settings, a very
  good way to incrementally learn these new features as you code.
