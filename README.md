A talk I gave in July 2017 about modern JavaScript programming. The first half is a series of
slides demonstrating new features in ES2015 and later standards, and how to use tools like
Webpack and Babel to make them available. The second half is a live-coding exercise in which I
build an app along with an ad hoc web framework, demonstrating the value of using a framework
while being suitable for an audience with varied skill level and familiarity with common
front-end frameworks.
